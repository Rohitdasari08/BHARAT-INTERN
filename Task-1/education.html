            <p>I completed my schooling at Dr.KKR's Gowtham EM HighSchool, Nellore.</p>
			<p>In high school there’s a big emphasis on reading and thinking critically.High school is a time of increasing Independence — not just socially and emotionally, but academically too. High-schoolers have more choices about which classes they take and when. The goal is for them to graduate with the skills they need to be ready for college or a career.An accommodating school fulfills all your wishes and needs. This means it is well-equipped with all the tools needed to foster and encourage learning, where I've passed my highschool with 9 CGPA .</p>

            <p>I completed my Intermediate at Narayana Junior College,Nellore.</p>
			<p>Intermediate is the first step toward career-oriented education. Generally, students take primary and secondary education less seriously but when they get to the intermediate level (college), it is time to take things a lot seriously because this is where careers can be constructed on solid ground, where I've passed Intermediate woith 9.4 CGPA</p>
